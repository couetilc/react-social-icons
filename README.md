### How to add new icons

Icons are stored in `src\_networks-db.js`

For example:

```
facebook: {
  icon:
    'M34.1,47V33.3h4.6l0.7-5.3h-5.3v-3.4c0-1.5,0.4-2.6,2.6-2.6l2.8,0v-4.8c-0.5-0.1-2.2-0.2-4.1-0.2 c-4.1,0-6.9,2.5-6.9,7V28H24v5.3h4.6V47H34.1z',
  mask:
    'M0,0v64h64V0H0z M39.6,22l-2.8,0c-2.2,0-2.6,1.1-2.6,2.6V28h5.3l-0.7,5.3h-4.6V47h-5.5V33.3H24V28h4.6V24 c0-4.6,2.8-7,6.9-7c2,0,3.6,0.1,4.1,0.2V22z',
  color: '#3b5998'
},
```

To add a new icon, you first need to find a copy of that icon as an svg file,
and a hex code for the social network's main color. Check the network's own
style guidelines or website for the official icon and color.

The 'icon' and 'mask' properties for each network in `networks-db.js` should
contain the vector information for the svg. The 'icon' is the foreground, so
the path for describes the shape of the icon itself. This will be transparent
by default. The 'mask' is the background area, so the path for this describes
the area between the surrounding circle and the icon shape. By default this
will take the color you provide in the 'color' property. The 'color' property
will set the background color for the icon. This should be the main color
associated with the social network.

An easy way to generate the path for the 'mask' is to begin with
'M0,0v64h64V0H0z', which defines the circular border, and follow this with the
exact same path that you used for the 'icon'.

Depending on the svg file that you start with, you may need to edit attributes
in the svg file such as width, height, and viewbox (see
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial) in order to put the
icon in the centre of the circular border. You can then use a tool such as
https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image to rewrite the svg path so you have a
nice simple path to use here in the 'icon' and 'mask', without needing those
extra attributes.

### Using Inkscape

These steps should work for most logos. Feel free to tweak any of the steps to
make the final svg look neater:

1. Open the SVG in Inkscape's editor and select `File > Document Properties` in
   the menu bar. Change the page's width and height to 64px.
2. Select the icon and click `Object > Transform` in the menu bar. Choose the
   "Scale" tab, check the box "Scale proportionally", set the height and width
   to be within 32px, and click the "Apply" button
3. Select the icon and click `Object > Align and Distribute` in the menu bar.
   Set relative to "Page" in the dropdown menu and click the buttons "Center on
   vertical axis" and "Center on horizontal axis".
4. Create a square starting at the origin with a width of 64px. Select
   `Object > Lower to Bottom` in the menu. Select `Path > Object to Path` in
   the menu.
5. Select both the square and icon. Click `Path > Exclusion` in the menu. You
   must convert all objects to paths and remove all groups before you can
   perform the Exclusion operation.
6. Select `File > Save a Copy` in the menu. Open the saved svg file in a text
   editor, find the `path` element, and copy the `d` attribute's value.
7. In the `react-social-icons` repository, open the `src/_networks-db.js` file
   and add a new entry in the object whose key has the same name as the social
   network's domain name. Set the property `icon` to `"M 0,0 H 64 V 64 H 0 Z"`.
   Set the property `mask` to the copied value from Step 6. Set the property
   `color` to the social network's brand color.
8. Commit your changes and preview the new icon by running `npm start` and
   visiting `http://localhost:1234` in your web browser. Once you're happy with
   the result, create a PR against master at
   https://github.com/jaketrent/react-social-icons, where it will be reviewed
   and merged. Thank you for contributing!

### Select icons to include in the bundle

A lightweight version of the component is provided in `react-social-icons/build/react-social-icons-lite.js`. This component requires individual icons to be loaded before use.

Each network icon can be imported from `react-social-icons/build/networks/`, like `react-social-icons/build/networks/facebook.js`.

```
import facebook from "react-social-icons/build/networks/facebook.js";
import github from "react-social-icons/build/networks/github.js";
import {
  SocialIcon,
  SocialIconDatabase,
} from "react-social-icons/build/react-social-icons-lite.js";

SocialIconDatabase
   .importNetwork(facebook)
   .importNetwork(github);

// ...

 <SocialIcon network="facebook" title="facebook" />
 <SocialIcon network="github" title="github" />
```

Importing only the used icons can reduce the final bundle size.
